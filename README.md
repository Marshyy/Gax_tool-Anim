You can now give path arguments and it converts every file in the path to .gax/.png 

Some changes (and possible errors you might face)
When outputting the files, If you an have an existing file with the same name and extension (which shouldn't be there 99% of cases) You will get an error.

Example input/output
 
Output.png -> Output.png.gax 

Input.gax -> Input.gax.png

The naming scheme is deliberate
